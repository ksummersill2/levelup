Level Up Code Submission

Appddiction Studio (ADS) has provided a repository containing the examples of previous work for technologies using Docker, Jenkins, and Terraform. The Docker allows users to containerize the application, which then allows users to move a sustainment application to the cloud without worrying about the environment/server that runs the application. The application can run on either the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Bean Stalk (ELB) or on an EC2 Virtual Machine from AWS. The Jenkins pipeline script is an example ADS has used to push code as part of a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. The application utilized a JDeveloper IDE and Oracle Database to check database objects to compile. The pipeline utilizes a Docker container with all the software required to compile code. The Terraform script is used to build an entire environment within AWS with ELB, EC2s (Bastion server), API Server, ELB (Workers), Security Groups, VPCs, Subnets, and more. To deal with Docker scalability, we added Kubernetes, Knative (with Istio) as well as Tekton (Pipeline CI/CD scripting) to the repository.
